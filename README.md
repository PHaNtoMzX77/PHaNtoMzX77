# Hiya, I am Phantom!
I am a self-taught UI and web designer who also dabbles in some light programming! I also use to make PPTOSes.
## Who am I?
I am a 14 year old (almost 15) who can design pretty well, I use figma mostly but I am trying to branch out to web design! I also enjoy programming small things if and when I can. I use to make these things called **PPTOSes** for a few years, but I lost the _motivation_ to do so anymore. I love the colour purple, my favourite animals are foxes and I also love playing games!
## What are my projects?
I am currently working on two projects right now!

[Wave](https://www.google.com/) - A lightweight web operating system designed to simplify the web experience.

[PHaNtoM's Discord Assistant](https://www.google.com/) - An all purpose discord management/assistant bot.
## Where can I contact you?
You should join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/SHk6UyZp7T), it's a small community with a rank based levelling system, project spaces and a fun community!

If you want to contact me seperately, add me on discord **@phantomzx77** or email me @ phantomzx77@gmail.com
